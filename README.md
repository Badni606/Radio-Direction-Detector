# Radio-Direction-Detector
A independent radio networking project undertaken during university.

I set out to learn about radio and microcontrollers by attempting to make a simple tracker system. In this, I configure 2 Xbee modules with microcontrollers to act as a seeker and hider, and study antenna designs to use for the seeker. I end up making a yagi-uda antenna, which resulted in decent results.
